# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) is an annual event where participants solve programming challenges in a variety of programming languages. It's a fun way to improve your programming skills, learn new languages, and have fun with coding.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. I'm doing this for fun, and to improve my programming skills. I'm using Python to solve the challenges, but I'm also planning to try using Go and Ruby for future challenges.

## How to use this repository

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and navigate to the appropriate directory for the day's challenges. Each day's challenges will be in a separate directory, with a separate file for each problem.

For example, to solve the first problem for day 1, navigate to the `day01` directory and open the `part01.py` file. Add `input.txt` with the given unique puzzle input, and then run the solution. To run the solution, run `python part01.py`.
